        <p>
          Vitamin C is often marketed as a “glow” ingredient, but its importance
          goes far beyond brightness. When your body or skin lacks Vitamin C,
          the effects show up slowly — and are often ignored.

          Why Vitamin C Matters
        </h2>
        <p>
          Vitamin C (ascorbic acid) plays a key role in collagen production,
          wound healing, antioxidant protection, and maintaining overall skin
          strength. Your body cannot make or store it for long periods.
        </p>

          What Happens When Vitamin C Is Low?
        </h2>
        <ul style={{ paddingLeft: "18px", lineHeight: "1.7" }}>
          <li>Dull, tired-looking skin</li>
          <li>Loss of firmness due to reduced collagen</li>
          <li>Slower healing of acne marks or wounds</li>
          <li>Gradual increase in pigmentation</li>
          <li>Higher sensitivity to sun damage</li>
        </ul>

          Severe Deficiency: More Than Skin
        </h2>
        <p>
          Long-term and severe Vitamin C deficiency can lead to scurvy, a
          condition marked by bleeding gums, fatigue, joint pain, and very slow
          healing. While rare today, mild deficiencies are still common.

        <h2 style={{ fontSize: "1.15rem", marginTop: "24px" }}>
          Can Skincare Replace Vitamin C Intake?
        </h2>
        <p>
          Topical Vitamin C helps protect the skin from environmental damage and
          supports collagen at the surface level. However, skincare cannot
          replace dietary Vitamin C.
        </p>
        <p>
          Healthy skin reflects internal health. If your diet lacks Vitamin C,
          no serum can fully compensate for that gap.
        </p>

        <h2 style={{ fontSize: "1.15rem", marginTop: "24px" }}>
          A Common Misconception
        </h2>
        <p>
          More Vitamin C does not mean better skin. Very high percentages or
          multiple Vitamin C products can irritate the skin, especially for
          sensitive skin types.
        </p>

        <h2 style={{ fontSize: "1.15rem", marginTop: "24px" }}>
          Our Honest Take
        </h2>
        <p>
          Vitamin C is important — but it is not magic. Balanced nutrition, sun
          protection, and a simple skincare routine matter far more than chasing
          high percentages on a label.
